# Happy-Birthday-Snap-CS-Principles
A short, simple Snap! program that plays the song 'Happy Birthday' on start. This is my third Snap! project for CS Principles.

#### How I Made it
This project was really simple. My teacher showed me how to use sound blocks, and then asked me to create a program that plays the first part of Happy Birthday. I wanted to do something a tiny bit harder than that, so I decided to do the full song. I looked up the notes and added them accordingly. I also added some timing between notes to make it sound closer to how people sing it.

#### How to Run it
If you see this and you'd like to view my project, follow these steps:
1. Download the "Happy Birthday (CS Principles).xml" file in this repository.
2. Go to https://snap.berkeley.edu/
3. Press the Run Snap! Now button.

4. You can either drag the file onto the Snap window or you can import it, up to you. Follow the steps below to import it. If not, skip to step 8.
